# Password-Generator

## Contenet in this application 
Here I have created a password generator where you the user inputs certain criteria when you the generate password button. 
After selecting the criteria, the code I have written randomly uses a mixture of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters to generate a password to a length you have specified.

## Here is a screenshot of the password generator webpage
